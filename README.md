# Parasite_biomass

This github repo provides code and data to reproduce the results in ["The impact of malaria-protective red blood cell polymorphisms on parasite biomass in children with severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria"](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.21.22271267v1) by Uyoga et al (preprint).

This is a genetic case-only association study which uses parasite biomass as measured by the plasma concentration of PfHRP2 as a quantitative phenotype.

The data are given in the files *kemri_case_data.csv* (cases) and *kemri_control_data.csv* (controls). All the analysis can be reproduced by running the RMarkdown file
